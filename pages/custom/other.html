<p>There are a few <em>very</em> draft-quality specs that are part of Houdini as well, but there's not enough in them to really cover, yet</p>

<ul>
  <li class="fragment"><a href="https://wicg.github.io/CSS-Parser-API/">CSS Parser API</a> - Parse CSS like string (individual rules and whole rulesets) in to Typed OM</li>
  <li class="fragment"><a href="https://drafts.css-houdini.org/font-metrics-api/">Font Metrics API Level 1</a> - Provide basic fonts metrics, like <code>width</code> of font line box, <code>height</code> between the highest top and lowest bottom of em squares, and <code>baselines</code> of all given text</li>
  <li class="fragment"><a href="https://drafts.css-houdini.org/box-tree-api/">Box Tree API Level 1</a> - An API for accessing information about how boxes are displayed and positioned from a layout</li>
